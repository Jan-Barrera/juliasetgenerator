Generating Julia Set fractals using math.js + HTML5

Fractals can be considered as a fusion of mathematics and art. By definition, fractals are mathematical sets that exhibit repeating patterns or self-similarity at every scale. They have a visual invariance regardless whether you zoom in or zoom out... and such a property provides much fascination that adds to its mystical beauty. 
Fractals are generated by iterating through a complex equation, i.e. continually taking the output of the equation as the next input. The Julia Set in particular can simply be expressed as a quadratic recursive equation in the complex plane: f(z) = z^2 + c; with c as a complex constant. Using math.js library to handle operations on the complex plane and HTML5 to create the canvas, beautiful fractals can be generated on a browser (that is not IE… sorry, I’m just biased against IE).
